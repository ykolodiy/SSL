1 Go to URL in your firefox browser, click on HTTPS certificate chain (next to URL address). Click "more info" > "security" > "show  certificate" > "details" > "export..". Pickup the name and choose file type example.cer. Now you have file with keystore and you have to add it to your JVM
2 Determine location of cacerts files, eg.   C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_101\jre\lib\security\cacerts
3 add cert to security\cacerts :    
       keytool -importcert -file COMODOECCCertificationAuthority.crt -alias jetty -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts
